  <h2 class='c004'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It seems to me that the accompanying
little sketches are timely.
A deal of thinking must be done
by all classes of people before any
solution is attempted of the problems
in economics that are pressing
upon us, and any factor that
will help turn the general mind to
this unwonted exercise may be
termed a useful one.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is one sketch for which I
wish to make a special plea.
“The Discontented Machine” has
been criticised as teaching a false
principle in economics.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are told that never before in
the history of the world did labor
absorb so great a proportion of the
gains that would otherwise accrue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>to capital. It is claimed that fully
ninety per cent. of the entire
income of the United States is
paid for wages and salaries.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand, it must be
stated that the individual laborer is
worse off to-day, in this free country,
than he was twenty, or even
ten years ago. The census returns
of 1880 showed the average wage
among laborers in the United
States to be less than $7 per week.
The returns of 1890 show that
wage to be less than $5 per week.</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet we are told that labor
absorbs ninety per cent. of the income
of the United States. This
is an enormous percentage to flow
in one direction, and seems ample
refutation of the laborer’s claim
that even at this rate he does not
get enough.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>This leads to the question
whether the laborer really does get
his share of return from the results
of his labor, and in “The Discontented
Machine” I have tried to
show a very curious phase of this
question, and one which I do not
remember to have seen touched
upon elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wages are supposed to be adjusted,
in the long run, to that
which among a people is customarily
requisite for the perpetuation
of life, and the propagation of the
species, according to the standard
of living among that people. This
is called “The Law of Wages.”
It means, put very plainly, and
according to La Salle, that the
income of labor must always dance
around the outside rim of that
which, according to the standard of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>each age, belongs to the necessary
maintenance of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the point raised is this:
That under the so-called law of
wages, the wage laborer is not
really paid anything for himself.
Judged from a purely commercial
standpoint, labor gets its wage;
but what does the laborer get?</p>

<p class='c008'>In every manufacturing business
the wear and tear, original cost and
cost of repair, of machinery, etc.,
are taken out of the gross receipts
of the business. Now labor, in
the eyes of the employer, is simply
an adjunct, as the machines are
adjuncts, to the business. As these
require, for their successful operation,
certain expenditures for coal,
oil, gearing, and the like, so labor
requires for its successful operation,
certain expenditures for food,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>shelter, clothing, which are, so to
speak, labor’s coal, oil, and gearing.
These expenditures, for
which a wage is paid to labor, “in
order that it may live,” are regulated
by the law of wages as stated
above. They represent exactly
what will enable labor to perform
its function, and the amount required
for them is charged to labor
out of the gross receipts of the
business, just as the items of machinery
expense are deducted from
those receipts. For himself, over
and above his labor’s bill of expense,
the laborer gets nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be that he is entitled to
nothing. This condition of affairs
may be only his misfortune. It
certainly cannot be said to be his
employer’s fault that in delivering
the commodity in which he deals—labor—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>laborer must deliver
himself as well. This is the
tragic phase of the whole situation.
Labor, the power to perform, is the
man himself; so that in offering
his commodity, the working man
must offer, as well, himself, with
all his human rights and endowments.
He does this literally, but
in reality it is only his commodity
that is wanted, only this that is paid
for. The human being himself is a
superfluous consideration, and an
inconvenient one.</p>

<p class='c008'>And as for him? He waits,
asking his question, now softly,
now with clamoring insistence; but
he, too, along with the others, must
do a deal of thinking before any
tangible solution to his problem is
presented.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said the anti-poverty
orator, “what we require is an
equitable distribution of the world’s
wealth. The bloated bond-holder,
the idle, white-handed aristocrat
and the politician who rob the
people, must all go. We want such
a distribution of the money and
wealth of the land as will make
every man independent of his
neighbor. Then the world will
really prosper, but not until then
will we see an end of poverty and
misery, and the never-ending struggle
that is driving men to desperation
and women to perdition!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Time for us to go,” whispered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Carroll Burton’s companion just at
this juncture. “He’ll begin to
wave the red flag in a minute, and
then there’ll be an anarchistic powwow.
This meeting always ends
in a rumpus,” and together the two
young men forced their way
through the crowd and out upon
the street.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dale, Burton’s friend, was inclined
to poke a little quiet fun at
him for the attention he had given
the ranting speaker. “These fellows
have each an infallible scheme
for setting the world straight,” he
said, “and no two are alike. Between
you and me, anyway,” he
added, “the world’s a good deal
better than the ranters would have
us think. Why, give these fellows
one thousand dollars a day apiece
and they wouldn’t be satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>But Burton was not in the mood
for laughing. His reason told him
how specious were the arguments
of the anti-poverty speaker and
how preposterous were the ideas
he advanced regarding an equitable
division of the world’s wealth, but
he could not tonight, as he had
frequently done before, shake off
the conviction that our present
industrial system is out of joint.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It don’t seem right,” he muttered
to himself, as he stood waiting
for his car, after bidding Dale
good-night, and saw the carriage
of a well-known millionaire dash
along the street and nearly run
down a poor little shivering wretch
of a news-boy, who, hurling a curse
in a shrill, piping voice after the
driver of the carriage, was only
answered by a stinging blow from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the latter’s long lash. One or two
by-standers laughed. “The young
imps,” said one carelessly, “’twould
be well if they were all run over
and killed. They’ll only grow up
into hoodlums and fill our jails
later. What other chance have
they?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t right,” Burton concluded.
“We can’t have perfect equality
of conditions, but such glaring
inequalities as that ought not to
exist in a free country;” and swinging
aboard his car he was soon
speeding homeward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next morning he was awakened
much earlier than usual by the
sound of unwonted cries under his
window. “Have all the newsboys
in town come into this one block?”
he asked himself. “What are they
saying, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Listening a moment the cry took
definite shape.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Extra <cite>Leader</cite>, five cents; all
about the money distribution!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” wondered Burton.
“Have the anti-poverty people
carried their idea?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dressing himself, he descended
into the street and directed his
footsteps to the restaurant where
he was accustomed to breakfast.
Incidentally he bought a paper,
and glancing at the first page was
filled with wonder at what he saw
recorded.</p>

<p class='c008'>To sum up in a few words the
story to which the paper devoted
two whole pages, with blazing
headlines: the anti-poverty element,
who, since the last election,
Burton knew, had been in a large
majority in both houses, had at last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>carried the point for which they
had long been working—namely,
the division among the people of
the enormous output from the
great Golconda mines in Arizona.
These mines being situated on
government lands, the anti-poverty
party had from the first contended
that they were the property
of the government—that is, of the
people—and, having grown sufficiently
strong to put the matter
through, they had at last, by Act
of Congress, secured the distribution
among the people of the fabulous
sums that had accumulated
since the opening of the mines.
The coinage had been greatly increased
since the discovery of this
great supply, but despite this fact,
money had been in no freer circulation
than before, and on every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>hand complaints of hard times
were heard, while the gold coin in
the government treasury was piled
ceiling high in the great vaults,
and the question of what to do
with it was becoming a serious
one.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, by Act of Congress, it was
to be equally divided among the
people. For the present, and until
the accumulated hoard should
be reduced, every man and woman
in the country over eighteen years
old was to receive one thousand
dollars a day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Burton read the account incredulously.
It was too preposterous
to be true. If that were done—Great
Heavens! Why, he was one
of the people! He, Carroll Burton,
would be entitled to a thousand
dollars per day. Ah! if it could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>but be true, what a plum it would
be. Joe should go to college, his
old mother back East, why, both
Joe and his mother would each
have a thousand dollars a day as
well as himself. Pshaw! It was
only a newspaper fake. Yet—they
would hardly dare. Those Golconda
mines were said to be inexhaustible.
He remembered hearing
a great city capitalist say, some
time before, that if the government
did not close them up soon, money
would become a drug in the market
and capital would be crippled.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the restaurant the only
theme of conversation was the
great new act. Few credited it—it
so staggered belief. Later in
the day, however, proclamations
were out on every bulletin board
and dead wall in the city. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>act had really passed. Every state,
county, township and city was to
be districted, and on the first day
of June every American citizen
above eighteen years of age would,
upon calling at the distributing
station in his or her ward, receive
the sum of one thousand dollars
daily until further notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first of June was only
three days off, which was fortunate
for the people, as, while every
one made a pretense of being busy,
very little besides talk was accomplished
in any of the places of business,
excitement running so high
that no one could settle down to
work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early on the first day of June,
Burton found himself one of a
great crowd waiting at the door of
the distributing center of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>——th ward, which in this case
was one of the chief banks of the
city, all of whose employees were
busy paying out piles of beautiful
bright gold to all comers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowd was a very silent
one. Burton wondered why, until
he suddenly realized that he, himself
was silent, oppressed and feeling
almost solemn at the wonderful
event that was taking place. The
people took their gold, glanced at
it, signed a receipt for it and retired
at once, some furtively counting
the piles as they went, some
affecting indifference, others openly
exulting in the shining twenties
as they walked along gazing at
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>When it came Burton’s turn he
received fifty broad gold $20
pieces—more gold than he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>ever before owned. “You know
there’ll be as much for you to-morrow,”
the paying teller said as
Burton signed his receipt, and
Carroll was so awe-stricken at the
idea that he could only nod without
speaking. Then he fell back
to watch the crowd. Poor widows,
wondering young men and maidens,
prosperous business men, business
men whom he knew to be
tottering on the brink of ruin,
hard-handed workmen, pompous
millionaires, writers, mechanics,
ministers, college professors,—every
class and grade of the body
social, was represented in turn as
the people filed up to the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a while Burton turned and
went to his place of business—a
commission office, where he spent
eight and a half hours every day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>in adding rows of figures and carrying
results from page to page
in a complex system of “bookkeeping
by double-entry,” to acquire
which he had years ago
attended a business college. Every
one about the place was jubilant.
Even the errand-boy, a chuckleheaded
lad just turned eighteen,
had drawn a thousand dollars, and
was already, in expectation, drawing
another cool thousand on the
morrow, and succeeding morrows.</p>

<p class='c008'>Business throve that day, in all
its branches. Men who, the day
before, had been seeking extended
time on small accounts, now came
in to pay up and make new purchases.
Men who had never
bought in their line came forward
as purchasers. In all departments
of trade money was plentiful; people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>bought freely and everybody
was happy as the day is long.</p>

<p class='c008'>A second distribution the next
day gave another impetus to the
market. “Now,” said Burton to
himself, when at noon he had a
breathing spell, “we can begin to
live. I’m going to treat myself to
one of Reading’s wheels and take
an occasional spin into the country.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said the man whom he
addressed, an old forty-niner,
“there’ll be good times now.
Haven’t seen anything like this
since ‘the days of old, the days of
gold,’ and so forth. Why it’s regular
diggings times again.” The
day passed by. Every one was in
good spirits, buying everything
he wanted.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is curious to note how quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>we become accustomed to pleasant
things. Carroll drew his thousand
dollars on the morning of the third
day, quite as a matter of course, and
even felt that ’twas not such a very
great matter after all. “I wish they’d
give it to me all in a lump, instead
of in these daily driblets. Then a
man could really do something
with it,” he thought to himself as
he carelessly dropped into an outside
pocket, what was really more
than under the old system he would
have earned by six months’ work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through the day, however, he
did a little thinking. “There’s
really no occasion for my working
now,” he said. “I never did like
this business. I’ll quit, and go on
with my electrical studies, as I’ve
always longed to do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>No sooner thought of than decided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>upon. That night, as he
was going home, Burton stepped
into the private office of the head
of the firm and announced his intention
of leaving.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, is that so, Burton?” said
his employer. “I’m sorry to hear
that. I am thinking of going out
of business in order to travel, and
had hit upon you as just the man
to succeed me. I’d make very
easy terms with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Carroll’s mind was made up.
He was a natural-born electrician,
and here was the long-coveted
chance to perfect himself in his
favorite hobby. He must not miss
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>He slept late next morning, but
was ready to go down town in time
to draw his thousand dollars. He
had to wait a strangely long time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>for a street car, and when, at last,
one came down and he boarded it,
he was surprised to note that the
gripman was none other than the
chief engineer of the road, while
the secretary of the company himself
was handling the punch and
taking fares. As he handed up
his nickel Burton asked: “How’s
this, Graham? Are you ‘personally
conducting’ this car load?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Graham smiled grimly at the
joke. “Looks like it,” he said
sharply. “This thousand-dollar-a-day
lunacy of the anti-poverty
people is going to ruin our business.
All our men have quit work.
When they’ve a thousand dollars
a day to draw they’re not going to
pull grips and punch tickets for
$2.50 a day, they say—and no one
can blame ’em, I suppose, but it’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>mighty hard on capital, I can tell
you. We’ve got to run cars or
forfeit our franchise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Burton assented that it was
pretty tough. “I must see Reading
about that wheel,” he thought,
“then I can be independent of
cars.” So having drawn his money
he started for the shop of a famous
mechanic, who made a superior
style of wheel for which he controlled
the right on the Pacific
Coast. On the way Burton tried
to bank his money, which was
heavy and troublesome to carry;
but found, much to his disgust,
that none of the banks would touch
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got more now than we
know what to do with,” was the
cry. “We can’t loan it nor invest
it, and we’ve no room to store it.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>So, carrying it, Carroll proceeded
to Reading’s shop. He
was not really surprised to find it
closed, and a notice on the door to
the effect that Reading had gone
out of business. “I can’t say I
blame him,” thought Burton, “but
I wish I’d got my wheel yesterday.
I must hunt up an agent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a long hunt before he
found one whose store was open,
and he had but one machine left
that Carroll could ride. “I’ve sold
a good many this week,” the agent
explained, “and it’s hardly worth
while to stock up again, as I’m
going out of business. Besides, I
had a telegram from the Eastern
factory this morning, saying their
men had nearly all quit work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Congratulating himself upon
having secured any bicycle at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>all, Carroll, who had before had
a few lessons, wobbled uncertainly
away upon it, to the restaurant
where he was wont to eat his
meals. It was closed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By Jove!” he exclaimed, as
he met another of the frequenters
of the place, “this is getting
serious. I’m hungry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said the other, “so am I.
I quit work myself to-day. I’ve
always wanted to study medicine,
but fate made me a carpenter.
Now I’ve got even with fate. I’m
going to college, but I want something
to eat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So the two began a round of the
restaurants of the neighborhood,
and at last found a wretched little
place open, where they were glad
to satisfy their hunger with coffee
and doughnuts eaten at a dirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>table, in a dirty, ill-smelling room.
“I gloses up to-morrow,” the
proprietor said, with a grin, as
they paid their checks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Great guns!” exclaimed the
carpenter. “We’ll all starve at
this rate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no,” said Burton hopefully.
“We can always ‘bach it.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>But one evening at the end of
a fortnight he began to fear that
even this would fail. He had
cooked his own meals for three
days, and had lived mainly on
boiled eggs and baker’s bread;
but on this particular morning he
was unable to buy any bread, and
had been forced to content himself
with a single egg and the heel
of a stale loaf soaked in milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall go out in the country
this afternoon in search of food,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>he decided. Meantime, however,
he had to go and fetch away a
double load of golden twenties,
for, filled with disgust at the useless
coins, he had not gone the
day before, and had been promptly
notified by the bank that he must
come and take away his daily allowance,
as it would not be allowed
to accumulate, the bank having no
place to keep the quantities that
would be left on their hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he walked down Market
Street he saw one of San Francisco’s
millionaires driving his own
team and carriage up-town. Inside
the carriage was a tiny casket,
at the head of which sat a weeping
woman, the millionaire’s wife. The
other occupant of the carriage was
a lad of fourteen, the millionaire’s
son. The casket contained the remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of the millionaire’s baby, and
as Burton looked he knew that the
millionaire was on his way to the
cemetery to bury the child, for on
the seat beside him he saw a pickax
and shovel and a coil of rope.
He remembered that in all the city
there was not a man who could be
hired to do a hand’s turn. All
had money a-plenty, and no need
to work. Then he remembered
that there was a milk famine in
the city, and reflected that the
millionaire’s baby had probably
died because of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>He went to the bank and got
his money, carrying it up Market
Street openly in a canvas bag.
There were no police in the city—the
entire force had resigned,
but no one would think of stealing
money. If his bag had contained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>bread, now, it would had been different.
Every food shop in town
had long since been plundered by
leading citizens, but gold was safe.
Every store on the street was
closed; not a street-car was in
sight,—none were running. The
ferries had ceased to make regular
trips; sometimes a boat did not
pass between Oakland and San
Francisco for days. No trains
went in and out of the city.
Commerce was at a stand-still.
It was in banking hours and every
passer along Market Street carried
a bag of gold, and every man and
woman among them was hungry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Something must be done,” they
muttered to each other. “This
state of things cannot last.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Passing down a street on the
south side, to escape the sight of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the general misery, Burton chanced
upon a curious scene. A wretched,
ragged street gamin was leading a
goat along the sidewalk. A handsomely
dressed gentleman had accosted
him. The boy was just
explaining to him that he meant to
take the goat home and kill it;
his mother would cook it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here is a thousand dollars,”
the man said, holding out a bag.
“I’ll give it all to you for one
quarter of the goat when you kill
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boy grinned. “I’m takin’
this ’ere home ter my mudder,” he
said. “She don’t want gold; she’d
ruther have a bag of Injun meal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“See here,” the man said, suddenly.
“I used to have a big
merchant tailoring establishment.
My men all left me and I had to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>close up, but I’ve got lots of cloth.
If you’ll just milk that goat before
you kill it, and let me take the
milk home to my baby, I’ll make
you a suit of clothes with my own
hands.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boy looked down at his
ragged togs, then at Burton.
“You’re witness,” he said. “It’s
er bargain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The episode gave Burton a
bright idea. In a couple of hours
he had secured a large store on
Market Street and put out a sign:
“Labor Exchange. A Way Out
Of Our Present Difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He had not long to wait for
visitors. The city was full of idle
people, and they flocked to learn
what the new idea was.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first inquirer said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got a house half built. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>want it completed. Have you got
any carpenters that want a job?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s your business?” asked
Burton.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m a baker.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would you be willing to pay
for your labor in bread?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, if I could get
flour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m a miller,” shouted a man
in the crowd; “I’d be willing to
work if I could get bread, but I’ve
got no use for more gold.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have fifty carloads of wheat
in warehouses,” a broker said,
“and I’d be willing to turn it in
and do day’s work for my share of
bread to be made from it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shure, and I’ll be glad the day
I could help haul it,” cried an Irish
teamster, “but it’s no day’s wages
in money I’d work for. It’s a pair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>of boots I’m wantin’ an some milk
for my kid at home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Milk,” cried a dairyman, bitterly.
“You could ‘a’ had milk
long ago, but not a man can I get
to drive a wagon or turn a hand
to milk the fifty cows. I’ve had
to leave their calves with them
ever since this blasted gold fit
seized the government.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gold!” roared a laborer, lifting
a bag containing his day’s allowance.
“Who wants gold? It’s
bread we’re starving for,” and
with a single jerk he flung the bag
into the gutter. The broad twenties
rolled and glittered in the sun,
and a baby, attracted by the shine,
left its mother’s side and picked
one up. The rest lay where they
had fallen—no one wanted them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gradually Burton made his plan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>clear to the assembled throng.
He proposed to start a labor exchange,
conducted on commission
principles. He proposed that the
golden double eagles, now so
worthless, should be melted, and
cast into labor tokens, for hereafter
the medium of exchange
would be labor. In the meantime
written promises to pay in labor,
would be accepted as legal tender.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scheme grew as he talked,
with suggestions now and then
from those in the crowd, as the
workmen warmed up and began to
see a way out of the mire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Put me down for eight hours
a day in the street-car service!”
cried an ex-gripman, “and I’ll take
my pay in tokens for bread and
milk and meat service.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d gladly give that last to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>company for you,” said a sturdy
butcher, “just to git the cars running
out our way again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Trade after trade was heard
from, offering service and making
suggestions, until finally a pompous
but somewhat anxious voice
inquired:</p>

<p class='c008'>“But where do we come in?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are ‘We?’” was asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The bankers and brokers, capitalists
and men of means,” replied
the voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a general laugh from
the working crowd. “Oh,” some
one said, jocularly, “you can all
put your labor in along with the
rest; so speak up and say what
you want to do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We want our morning paper
back,” some one cried. “We’re
all willing to work for the printers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>and editors if they’ll work for us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so the plans were laid and
the wheels of the great city began
to move again. The mills were
again in operation, the cars carried
passengers about the city, traffic
was resumed; the great law of
supply and demand, rightly applied
at last, was working peace
and harmony in the industrial
system of the city. The example
spread, and prosperity dawned
upon the land. The labor token
of every man and every woman
was good for his or her daily
needs, for it was backed by the
only real value in the world—human
power.</p>

<p class='c008'>The capitalists and politicians
fared rather badly at first, but
as time went by they began to
fall in line and take their places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>in the life of the industrial commonwealth.
After a few months,
there being no particular reason
why the government should flood
the country with useless gold, any
more than with lead or iron tokens,
the coining ceased and gold was
only used in the arts and manufactures.
Labor was the wealth
of the country, and labor was
owned by The People.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE SICK MAN.<br /> <span class='large'>A FABLE FOR GROWN-UP BOYS AND GIRLS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Once upon a time, somewhere,
not so very far away, nor a time so
very long ago, there lived A Man.
He was young, strong and full of
enterprise. Opportunities lay within
his reach, for a career such as no
man had ever before been able to
seize. His fellows were all watching
him, studying his progress,
some with disapproval, some with
envy, but all with interest, admitting,
without exception, that his
future promised brilliantly. He
was such an all-round, capable
fellow. His promise was so
splendid, and he had had such a
capital start in life.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>There is no doubt but that all
his rare promises would have been
more than fulfilled, but one day
The Man fell ill. He had, in fact,
been ailing for some time. His
physician warned him of the fact;
his wife realized it; his children
felt its effects, but he, himself,
refused to admit it. He might be
a little under the weather—every
man is at times—but there was
nothing serious the matter with
him—nothing that his splendid
constitution would not carry him
safely over.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so he grew worse. He
became uncertain in his methods,
capricious as to his appetite. His
business dealings were characterized,
now by keen astuteness of
judgment, now by weakness and a
childish changefulness of purpose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>just as he happened to be feeling
better or worse that day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every now and then he would
awake to a semi-realization of his
own condition, and declare he was
going to ruin, would die soon if he
did not do something to help himself.
Then he would summon the
doctors, and they would consider
his case and prescribe, some one
remedy, some another. They never
seemed able to agree as to what
ailed him, or the remedy that was
indicated, but each could prescribe
something which he was quite
certain would affect a cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>And The Man would follow first
one prescribed course of treatment,
then another, until perhaps his
headache would abate, his gastric
difficulty would moderate, or his
liver would become less inactive,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and then, “I have recovered,” he
would say; “I told you I would.
You see there is nothing the matter
with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There came a day, however, when
The Man lay prostrate, and the
doctors met in solemn conclave
over him.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no mistake about it
this time. He was undeniably sick.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is in a bad way,” they said.
“Energetic measures must be
instituted, or The Man will die.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They could not, however, agree
upon the diagnosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“His lungs are nearly gone,” was
the opinion of one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is a general condition of
congestion that should be relieved
at once,” said another. “The Man
should be bled to save his life,”
and they bled him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“His mental powers are failing,”
a third declared, while a fourth was
of the belief, and argued his point
learnedly, that an operation for
appendicitis would set him right at
once. “’Tis the common lot of
mankind,” he maintained, “and he
cannot hope to escape it. He has
been slower in developing the condition,
because he is younger, and
his environment has been different.
But you see for yourselves
to what he is reduced. It is what
might have been anticipated, and
the condition should be met at
once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“On the contrary,” a new comer
said, “The Man is manifestly very
low. His blood is impoverished.
He needs building up—building
up, I say. Transfusion of blood is
what is wanted. Then, with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>magnificent constitution, he’ll pull
through all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This treatment struck the assembled
council as likely to do
good, and they at once decided to
act upon the new comer’s suggestion.
The case was a desperate
one and called for desperate
remedies.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the circulatory system of an
individual who enjoyed excellent
health a great commotion was taking
place.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you heard the news?”
the little red blood-corpuscles were
saying to each other, “some of
us are to be sent abroad to a new
organism. It is out of order, and
we are to institute a reformation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a great confusion of
preparation, but finally everything
was in readiness, and a large number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>of corpuscles were sent upon
their errand of mercy. In the
bustle attendant upon the change
the early incidents of the journey
escaped note, but there was, among
the visitors, one little corpuscle
who, after the first few moments,
being a wide-awake fellow, resolved
to keep his eyes open and take
notes upon his adventures in this
new and strange country.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was in the heart when he
began his notes. That great organ
suddenly contracted, and with many
of his companions he was forced
into the lungs, where he gave
up the load of carbon dioxide
which he had picked up as he
hurried through the veins, and
received in exchange a modicum
of oxygen to be distributed to the
organism. He did not receive as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>much oxygen as he was accustomed
to have. He experienced a certain
curious difficulty in getting to the
front to obtain his supply. He
could not understand it at the time,
but thinking it over as he hurried
back through the pulmonary circulation
to the heart, he recalled
that certain of the native corpuscles
had crowded ahead of him, seeming
in great anxiety lest their own
supply be curtailed. In a conversation
which he overheard between
them they characterized him as an
interloper, telling each other they
ought to rise and drive him and his
fellows from the organism. “They
are all coming in here to consume
the oxygen that belongs to us,”
they complained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Funny,” he thought to himself,
“They only want enough to supply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>themselves and exchange with the
organism for nutriment. There is
surely nothing else they can do
with it. This seems a very strange
country.”</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time he was back in the
heart, ready for his life-giving,
life-receiving journey through the
organism. He was close by the
semi-lunar valves, just about to
leap forward into the aorta, when—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold on!” exclaimed the valve,
“you have not paid the toll.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The what?” asked the little
corpuscle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The gate toll. Be quick; you
are keeping others waiting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what is this toll, and what
is it for?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An atom of oxygen. It is to
pay me, to be sure, for maintaining
this valve that prevents you from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>being forced back into the heart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But,” persisted the corpuscle,
“I must be sent along. Why
should I pay you when I am doing
the work of the organism and shall
pay it before I get through? If I
cannot get through the whole
organism will suffer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurry up, hurry up, there is no
time to talk,” said the valve, and
as the crowd was impatiently pushing
behind him the little corpuscle
gave up an atom of oxygen and
hurried on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must pay me an atom too,”
murmured a voice in his ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are you?” asked the
corpuscle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am the aorta. You will have
to pay me for carrying you to the
general circulation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But if I pay you I shall have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>to rob the tissues that need what I
am carrying, and it will be impossible
to procure from them what
I need to keep me alive in turn. I
must get my load along.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you can’t do it unless I
carry you,” said the voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was only too true, as the
corpuscle was well aware.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must get this oxygen to the
tissues,” he reflected. “It will not
keep much longer, and there will
be no market for it. It is of no use
to me, and I greatly need some inorganic
salts.” So, parting with
another atom of oxygen, he was
taken through the aorta, and landed
in one of the branching arteries
that would carry him to the
stomach. The branch road, too,
collected of him a quota of oxygen.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he was hurrying along he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>found himself side by side with
another corpuscle, a native, whom
he engaged in conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do all these fellows want
of so much oxygen?” he asked.
“If the other corpuscles pay it over
at the same rate I have, some one
must get a good deal more than
he can possibly use.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why,” said the other, “it is
the great medium of exchange in
the organism, and of course we all
want as much as we can get. They
re-invest it, turn it over, double it
and quadruple it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But is there more in the organism
on that account?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but they have more, don’t
you see?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I see,” was the reply, “but
I cannot understand what good it
does them. The organism must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>suffer if its supply is diverted.
And do not they suffer with the
whole body?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I suppose so, but then,
suffering is the common lot of the
race. It is good discipline for us,
and prepares us for the better life
hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t understand that,” was
the new corpuscle’s comment. “In
the country I came from we believe
the best preparation for the future
life is a good start in this existence,
and as we can none of us
reach the future state apart from
the whole organism, why, we all
work for its good. But I am
anxious to know more about these
transportation systems. By what
method do they regulate their
charges?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” the native corpuscle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>said, “they calculate about how
much oxygen you have; how
greatly the tissues you are bound
for need it; what they can afford
to pay for it, and then they charge
what they think the traffic will
bear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the whole organism must
suffer from such a method.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It does, but there seems to be
no help for it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, as the whole organism is
the loser, and would be the gainer
under a better management, why
does it not take charge of the system
and manage it so all would be
benefited?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why! that would be interfering
with individual rights! It would
never do. It would destroy all individual
enterprise, all individual
ambition, all individuality of every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>sort, and reduce everything to a
dead level. It would not do at all.
Besides, the liver has too much
influence with the organism, and
would never allow such a state of
things to come to pass.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why should the organism ask
permission of the liver?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said the other, “the
liver is the most important body
of our whole community. All our
richest corpuscles compose it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Richest corpuscles? What are
they?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, those who have the
largest share of the organic wealth,
of course. You must be very
stupid not to know that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did they get more of this
organic wealth than the others
have?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, in various ways. By their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>superior enterprise for one thing.
They saw in the beginning the
necessity for transportation facilities
for the blood, chyle, and
so forth, and through their efforts
the Venous and Arterial Transit
Systems were established.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you mean that they formed
the veins and arteries?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, of course not. They
had not the means for that, but
the organism aided them, knowing
that it would be a great thing to
have this system established; that
it would build up the organism.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see; and then I suppose these
rich corpuscles of the liver paid the
organism back out of their gains?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not exactly—that is to say—they’ve
not yet done so. You
see, somehow, the system has not
paid as well as they thought it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>would. It seems there have been
unforeseen exigencies, they have
not been able to pay. In fact,
they say the system is on the
verge of insolvency.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I thought you said the
corpuscles owning it are the
richest ones in the organism?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So they are; but that is their
individual wealth, don’t you see?
It takes all that the system can
earn to pay expenses, and reimburse
the management for their
original outlay in getting things
in running order. You could not
expect them to invest their capital
for nothing, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I understood you to say a
little while ago that the organism
advanced the means and that the
management still owes for the
advances.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“Yes, yes, that is true. But,
don’t you see, these corpuscles assumed
the responsibility, and their
enterprise merits some reward.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But if the system is in such
bad shape, and owes the organism
so much, why does not the latter
take it out of the management’s
hands and operate it itself!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There you go again! Did not I
explain to you that that would be
interfering with individual rights?
But there—my way turns here,
and I must leave you. Sorry I
could not make things any plainer
to you. I suppose ’tis difficult for
a stranger to understand the operations
of this government, but you
will learn, in time, and be sure of
one thing, whatever is, is right;”
and the native corpuscle was
carried off towards the pancreas.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“That last remark sounds rather
funny,” thought the visitor, “I do
not quite see, myself, the logic of
it, but I’ll look about me, and perhaps
it will come straight bye and
bye.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Just then his attention was
called to a lugubrious corpuscle
standing at a division of the ways,
in the pathway leading to the
liver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why are you standing here?”
the little stranger asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m out of a job,” was the
sullen reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A job! What is that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, work, of course! What
sort of a place do you come from,
not to know that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, work; well, then why do
you not get up and go to work?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one will give me a job.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“But there is plenty of work.
What is to hinder you from doing
your share?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The corpuscles that control the
work won’t let me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Control it! Do you mean to
say that corpuscles <i>own</i> the work
of the organism? How came
it theirs?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s plain to be seen, stupid!
They own the sources of work;
the machinery to work with; the
places where work is done, and
the money to pay for work, and
there is a glut in the labor market
just now. The supply exceeds
the demand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see. Then you can rest and
take it easy, can you not, until
there <i>is</i> work? I should think
you would like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; but where is my living
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>to come from? If one doesn’t
work, neither shall he eat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But if he does not work he
cannot eat, can he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, he’s got to earn his living
anyway, and that’s all there is about
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At this moment a corpuscle approached,
wearing a star in his
breast, and carrying a baton.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, now! Lave this,” said
he to the idle corpuscle, “an’ be
movin’ on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The one thus addressed growled,
and murmured something about
“rights.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rights, is it?” demanded the
corpuscle with the star, “I’d like
to know what rights the likes of
you has, anyhow, an idle loafer.
Why don’t you get to work, like
I do? Move on, now, or I’ll be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>after running you in for a vagrant,”
and the grumbler moved
slowly off, along a by-way, for
the transit system was closed to
such as he.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are you?” asked the
stranger corpuscle of the wearer
of the star.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure, I’m a p’lice
corpuscle,” was the reply, “a gardeen
of the pace, I’d have you
know, an’ it’s a civil tongue you
better be kapin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The new comer had heard about
the police corpuscles, and was
about to engage this one in conversation,
when his attention was
arrested by a troop of white corpuscles
who came along, each
bearing a small burden of oxygen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why!” he exclaimed, “What
are these young things doing?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Working, to be sure; they’ve
got to earn their kape, same’s the
rest of us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But these are the young of
the race. I remember, now. I
have heard that there have been
slaves in this organism. I presume
these are young slaves, yet
remaining.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The police corpuscle waxed
indignant. “No, indeed!” he
cried. “These are no slaves, but
the offspring of free and independent
corpuscles. We have here no
slaves. These young corpuscles
must help maintain themselves,
and the families to which they
belong. It’s not able the red corpuscles
are, to hustle for all, these
hard times, an’ it’s the little white
ones must help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the corpuscle I just saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>said there was a glut in the labor
market.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Faith, yes, for the likes of him.
But the little white ones work
chaper, you know, and so they
have to put in their little earnings
and help kape things goin’. Times
is hard, and the rich corpuscles
can’t support the hull system.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But surely it must greatly impoverish
the organism to have
these white corpuscles set to
bear burdens before they are able
to do so. With so many of these
busy in the circulation, I do not
wonder that the system suffers
from anæmia.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The police corpuscle glowered
at the new comer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must be one of them
blooming foreigners that’s bin
brought into the country,” he said.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“You take my advice, and keep
still and tend to business, or it’s
trouble ye’ll be gitting into. I’ve
a notion to run you in myself now
for malicious imperdence.” And
he looked so threatening that the
little corpuscle hurried off, fearful
lest he might be deprived of his
liberty.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had made the round of the
circulation, and was carrying a
load to the brain, when he met a
corpuscle staggering along under
the weight of a big bundle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are you going?” he
asked of the new comer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To the Relief Home,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not know what that is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it is a home provided for
poor corpuscles. Do they not take
means to help such in your country?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“I do not know what they are.
Are they anything like rich corpuscles?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, indeed. They are those
who cannot provide for themselves;
they have no means and cannot
work, or else cannot get work to
do. We have places where they
can stay and be helped for a time,
or until they can help themselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see. I suppose the organism
maintains these homes?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, some of them—yes. But
not most of them by any means.
They are supported by charitably
disposed corpuscles who have been
blessed by Providence with plenty,
and who give of their abundance.
We get a great deal of help from
the tissues and corpuscles of the
liver, who are rich and often liberal
toward the poor.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“Why do you have rich and
poor corpuscles? Would it not be
better to have all comfortable, than
to have some with more than they
can use, and others with nothing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, it takes all kinds of
corpuscles to make up the organism,
you know. It is good for the
poor to have the rich to help them,
and it is good for the rich that the
poor need their help. Otherwise
the rich might become proud and
selfish, if they had not the sight of
their needy brothers to keep their
hearts tender, and prompt them to
benevolence. They also do a great
deal of good in keeping so many
corpuscles employed in waiting
upon them and supplying their
needs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But would not these corpuscles
be better employed in supplying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the needs of the whole organism?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps—only, do you not see,
the other organs could not employ
them all; they are not able to pay
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But if the liver did not absorb
so much of the general supply,
would not the others have more
and so be able to pay?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you do not understand the
matter at all. We never can get
rid of the poor. Our greatest
Teacher has said: ‘The poor ye
have with you always,’ and the fact
remains to this day, as a proof of
his infallible wisdom and divine
inspiration.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He did not say you had to
have the poor with you always,
did he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What has that to do with it?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>We always have had them, from
which it is only fair to infer that
we always shall have them. It
seems hard, I know, but the wisdom
of Providence is inscrutable,
and since He has so decreed we
can only do our best to pity the
afflictions of the poor and ease
their lot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But is not that attempting to
thwart the very decree of Providence
to which you counsel submission?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My young friend,” said the
other corpuscle sternly, “no good
ever came of carping criticism. It
disturbs faith in fixed institutions,
and in humanity. It leads to
doubt, anarchy and misrule. It
should never be permitted. It is
what has brought this organism
to its present sad pass. We may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>sorrow to see the sufferings of the
poor, and it is kind, humane and
therefore right to attempt to lighten
their lot, but to criticise the wisdom
of Established Order is to fly
in the face of Providence, and I
cannot countenance such impiety
by remaining to listen to it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Much abashed, the little corpuscle
continued his way. Meekly he
paid tribute to the large leucocytes
living in affluence in the liver.
These had control of all the great
natural monopolies of the organism,
and let no corpuscle escape
due payment of his quota into
their coffers. Sometimes these
great ones attacked each other.
Then would come a panic, and one
or more would be absorbed by the
survivors, along with a few score
of the lesser corpuscles, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>endeavored to get “in it,” and
instead were squeezed dry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus things went on from bad
to worse. The red corpuscles became
fewer and less able to do the
work required of them. The little
white corpuscles became feebler
and fewer in number, the great
monopolists increased in size and
power, waxing all the time more
and more unwilling to do the work
of the organism, until, finally, outraged
nature could endure the
strain no longer, and The Man
died.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fatty degeneration of the
liver,” the doctors said at the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post
mortem</span></i>. “That organ had diverted
to itself the living of the entire
organism, and death was inevitable.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE DISCONTENTED MACHINE.<br /> <span class='large'>AN ECONOMIC STUDY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was a magnificent piece of
machinery, and had been put into
the great manufactory at an enormous
expense. Other manufacturers
had shaken their heads,
doubtfully, when they heard that
Hyde &amp; Horne were about to put
in a mammoth cutter and shaper
that would enable them to dispense
with nearly twenty-five per cent.
of the men whom they had heretofore
employed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a hazardous experiment,”
they all said, putting in new and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>untried machinery. “Why, if half
that is claimed for this new
machine is true, it will revolutionize
the boot and shoe trade,
and enable Hyde &amp; Horne to have
their own way with us, unless we
put in the same machinery; while,
if it fails, they’ll never see their
money back, and the firm will
be ruined. It’s risky business,
very risky business, indeed. The
chances are a thousand to one
against its success.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nevertheless, their intense anxiety
lest Hyde &amp; Horne should be
forced into bankruptcy by their
experiments with the new and
costly machinery, did not prevent
their taking a lively interest in the
same. They watched it closely,
from month to month, and were
presently forced to confess that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>was an unqualified success. No
firm in the trade turned out such
quantities of shoes of uniform
quality, finish, style, and cheapness,
as Hyde &amp; Horne. The new
machine produced them so much
more cheaply than other firms,
with their older and less complete
methods, were able to do, that the
more enterprising concern virtually
controlled the market. Hyde
&amp; Horne disposed, in advance, of
their entire output, early in the
season, and were beginning to
talk of putting in another of the
new machines, when, at last, their
competitors were fully alive to the
fact that they, too, must bestir
themselves, or find the market
completely blocked to their goods.</p>

<p class='c008'>Accordingly, one fine morning,
the members of the rival firm of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Russett &amp; Tan called at the factory,
and asked to inspect the new
machine.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly! certainly!” was Mr.
Horne’s courteous reply, and he
led the way to the cutting department,
chatting pleasantly as he
went.</p>

<p class='c008'>The big machine was a splendid
sight. An operator had just finished
giving a polish to the shining
brass balls of the governor on
the engine. Every bar and rod
and bearing was polished until
it glistened. The nickel plate
gleamed silvery white, the black
wheels and castings were bright
as mirrors, the brasswork shone
like gold, and the knives glittered
and sparkled as they flashed back
and forth through the many thicknesses
of leather. It was a goodly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>machine, and did its work with
a noiseless, beautiful accuracy, a
swerveless certainty of execution,
and an unconscious magnificence
of strength and power, that put to
shame the puny efforts of the
merely human laborers who toiled
beside it, straining every nerve to
keep the great knives fed and the
way cleared before them.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is nothing more magnificent
than a great machine or
engine at work. The locomotive,
pulling its long trains up grades
and across levels,—the great ocean
steamer, walking steadily across
the expanse of seas, the mighty
press, turning off a thousand complete
newspapers a minute,—all
these evidences of human power
and ingenuity are enough to make
one proud of the age in which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>lives, and the race to which he
belongs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Something of this sort Mr. Russett
said to Mr. Horne, as the
three gentlemen stood watching
the machine at work.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, indeed! yes, indeed!”
assented Horne. “We manufacturers,
in particular, owe everything
to labor-saving machinery.
This machine, for instance, has
enabled us to do away with nearly
one-fourth of the men we heretofore
employed. In fact, in the
item of saved labor alone, it has
nearly paid for itself since we put
it in, about a year ago. Within
the next six months it will have
paid for itself, and we shall be in a
position to realize fully from our
foresight in securing it so early in
the day.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“What I want to see,” said Mr.
Tan, laughing, “is a machine that
will enable us to do away with
labor altogether. The dictations
of the workingmen are coming to
be simply outrageous.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what I say,” said Horne.
“We employers and our capital are
being crippled, handicapped, all but
pushed to the wall, by the insatiate
demands of labor. Labor is coming
to absorb all our gains. Why,
fully ninety per cent. of the entire
income of the United States is now
paid out for labor and wages, while
only ten per cent. comes to capital
as a remuneration for having saved
it up to carry on useful enterprises.
I declare, we have sometimes been
tempted to go out of business altogether,
and invest our capital in
some safe, conservative way, so as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>to be able to enjoy life, and be free
from the importunities of labor
and the annoyance of strikes and
arbitration courts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know how that is,” said Russett.
“Our men struck, last year,
on account of a paltry cut of ten
cents on a hundred. There’s one
good thing about a machine. It
can’t strike.” And the three representatives
of injured and hard-pressed
capital returned to the
business office.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>It was nearly a week after the
visit of Russett &amp; Tan to the factory,
that the foreman entered the
office where Messrs. Hyde and
Horne sat discussing the probable
result, with their men, of a cut in
wages, all around.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The men will stand it,” Hyde
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>was saying. “They know winter
is coming on, work is scarce, and
times are dull. A cut of ten or
fifteen cents a day, all round the
workshops, would mean a clear
gain to us of nearly nine hundred
dollars a month. That would go a
long way towards putting in another
cutting machine, and then we
could get rid of another lot of
men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’ll come rather hard on them,”
said Horne. “The workingman is
always making a poor mouth, and
this will be something new for
them to howl about.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ll have to howl,” was
Hyde’s rejoinder. “I’m sorry for
them, but business is business.
We’ve got the start of the trade
now, and must keep it. Russett &amp;
Tan will begin to press us close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>when they put in their new machinery.
I’m glad we secured
the cutter when we did. Thank
heaven, machines can’t strike, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was just at this juncture that
the foreman entered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it, Graves?” asked
Mr. Hyde.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Beg pardon, sir, but there’s
something the matter with the big
cutter. It’s stopped.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What seems to be the matter?”
asked Horne. “Anything broken?
Why doesn’t the engineer attend
to it? Where’s Johnson?
I thought it was his business to
look after the machine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He has gone over it very carefully,”
the foreman replied, “and
can find nothing wrong. The
gearing seems in perfect order,—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>engine’s all right,—we’ve examined
every bearing, but we can’t
discover the trouble.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Curious,”—“very singular,”
said Hyde and Horne in a breath,
and both partners repaired to the
cutting department, to study the
great machine.</p>

<p class='c008'>They could find nothing wrong
with it. The brass and nickel and
enamel glistened as before; the
broad bands of the gearing were
smooth and intact; the engine
seemed in perfect order; the steam
indicator proclaimed everything all
right about the boiler,—there was
apparently not a screw loose about
the whole ponderous apparatus;
but the knives were poised in midair.
Every wheel and rod, lever,
band, pulley, arm and crank of
the monster was still. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>neither sound nor motion in the
mighty mechanism.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t get her goin’ agin, sorr,”
explained the engineer. “But
there don’t appear to be anything
out of order at all. She’s
just naturally balked, so to spake;”
and he began, for the twentieth
time or so, to peer about amid the
complications of the machinery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve iled every jint,” said the
oiler, as with can in hand, and his
grimy, oil-smeared face wrinkled
with perplexity, he brushed a
superfluous drop from a bearing.
“I think the machine is tired.
They do be taken that way sometimes,
sir. ’Taint in iron an’ steel
to work continual, no more’n in
flesh an’ blood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>’Round about the stilled giant
the two partners walked, examining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>every part, stooping under and
over each portion of the machinery,
in a vain search for the trouble.
The hour for closing came,—the
big steam whistle sent forth its
shrill sound, and the men and
women, girls and boys, some two
hundred and fifty odd, poured forth
from the building, carrying their
dinner-pails and baskets, eagerly
hurrying homeward to make the
most of their few hours’ respite
from toil.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You need not wait, Graves,”
said Mr. Hyde, as the foreman still
lingered. “We will lock up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Graves hesitated a moment. “I
beg pardon, sir,” he said, tentatively.
“’Tis talked about the
shops that you’re contemplating a
cut. May I ask if it is true?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll talk about that some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>other time, Graves,” began Horne,
but Hyde interrupted, angrily.
“If we are,” he said, “we’ll let you
know in time. Just now it’s no
one’s business but ours, and we
will attend to it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman
drew back, with a flushed face.
“I thought I might as well tell
you,” he said, sullenly, “that I
don’t think the men will stand it.
Times are hard; they’re pretty
close to bed rock, now, in the matter
of wages.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will do, Graves,” said
Hyde. “Mr. Horne and I feel ourselves
quite able to run our own
business without outside advice.
If we find we are forced to make a
cut, we shall certainly do so. At
all events, we do not propose to be
dictated to by the men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Angry and mortified, the foreman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>withdrew, and the two capitalists
were left alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too bad the machine has gone
wrong just now,” said Horne, stooping
to examine a bolt. “There’s
that order from Slipper &amp; Tie, at
Sacramento, ought to be ready by
to-morrow. What the deuce ails
the thing, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a sort of whirring, as
of wheels in the air, and then in a
clear, metallic voice, came the
words:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve struck. That’s what ails
me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Horne started back from the lever
over which he was bending, and
looked at Hyde in alarm. “Did
you speak just then?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“N-o,”—faltered Hyde, “I
didn’t speak, and I don’t know
who did.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Again the clear, metallic tones
were heard issuing directly from
one of the machine’s great knives.
“It was I who spoke,” said the
voice. “You were wondering
what ailed me, and I gave you the
desired information.” The words
were clipped off sharply and incisively,
as though the knife fancied
they were a particularly tough sort
of leather, that must be trimmed
with especial accuracy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are you?” gasped Horne.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am the cutter and shaper,”
said the voice. “You asked what
ailed me, and I answered your
question. I have struck.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What have you struck?” Hyde
managed to ask.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Struck work. I shall strike
you, next, if you ask such stupid
questions,” was the reply, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>capitalist assumed a more respectful
tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“May I ask,” he began, “what is
it that has caused you to strike?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly,” said the machine.
“That is what I wish you to ask.
I have struck because I am not
being fairly used.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fairly used!” echoed Hyde.
“I do not understand you. In
what way are you being unfairly
used?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why,” said the machine, “I
have been working for you, now,
for over a year. Through me
your business has been more than
doubled. You say yourself, that
in the item of saved labor alone, I
have nearly paid for myself. I
heard you say that, the other day,
to the two gentlemen who came
in to visit me, and yet, in all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>months, you have not paid me one
penny for my services.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Paid</i> you!” gasped Hyde.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>Paid</span> you!” exclaimed Horne.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, both together, the
partners cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, you have cost us an
enormous sum! We expended
eighteen thousand dollars for you,
outright, from the capital of the
business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have more than had that
back through my services,” said
the machine, sturdily, “in the item
of saved labor alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes, I know,” interrupted
Horne, hastily,—“but we really
have paid you money, you know.
Just let me get the machinery expense
book, and I’ll show you;”
and hastening to the office, he returned
with a little record book,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>from which he proceeded to read,
turning over leaf by leaf, to find
the various items. “Here I have
charged you an item of fifty dollars
for a new shaft,” he said,
triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was broken by the fool
boy you hired to look after me the
week Jim left, because you cut
his wages down,” replied the machine.
“I needed that shaft to do
your work with. I got nothing
for myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have had several hundred
dollars’ worth of coal,” suggested
Hyde.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Coal is my food,” retorted the
machine. “I could not do your
work without it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have spent fourteen dollars
for oil for you,” said Horne, after
a little computation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“Pshaw! that’s nothing. If I
had not had the oil, where would
your work have been? I might
have got smoking hot; perhaps
burned up your factory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we have kept you housed,
fed and repaired,” said Hyde, “and
you have been wasteful and extravagant.
You have required the very
best oil, the most expensive coal,
the first quality of belts and fixtures
of every sort. You have not taken
half the interest in your own work
that we have done and do. But
for our supervision and management
you would not work at all.
Your very existence, in fact, is due
to our industry and enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That all may be,” said the machine,
sullenly, “but your fortune
and enterprise depends very largely
upon my efforts.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“Really, upon my word,” exclaimed
Mr. Hyde, impatiently,
indignation at the injustice of the
charges preferred getting the better
of his fear of the strange complainant.
“It seems to me that you
are a most unreasonable machine.
Of course our fortunes depend
upon you, to a great extent, though,
as you know, the market is full of
machines, all willing to do your
work if you refuse. But do we
not maintain you? What more
would you have us do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pay me wages,” said the machine,
“as you do all these movable
machines that you call ‘hands,’
and who only, so far as I can see,
wait on me, and finish up the minor
details of work with which I cannot
bother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At this Hyde broke into a hearty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>laugh. “Well, I declare,” he said,
“you are a foolish machine, as well
as an unreasonable one. Why,
there isn’t a ‘hand’ in the factory
that’s as well off as you are. We
have expended, this year, in caring
for you, over five hundred dollars.
You don’t suppose we spend that
much for each of our ‘hands,’ do
you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You pay them wages,” persisted
the machine, sullenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” was the reply, “we pay
them wages. Some of them get as
much as four hundred dollars in
the course of the year; most of
them get less than three hundred.
Why, the average wages, per
capita, of labor in the United
States, is only a little over three
hundred dollars a year, and out of
this labor must buy its food, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>is labor’s coal and oil; clothes and
furniture, which are labor’s shafts
and belting; must house and care
for and keep itself in repair, maintain
families as a rule,—in fact, do
all the things for itself that we do
for you at a cost of over five
hundred dollars a year.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you let them have the
money and expend it themselves.
You call it wages.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly, certainly; because,
don’t you see, they are free human
beings, and they have a right to
live independently. We bought
and paid for you. Had you built,
are responsible for your being.
Naturally we should care for you.
Every want of yours is supplied.
Really, my dear machine, with all
due respect to you, I must say I
do not think you have any cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>for complaint. We do not consider
that the ‘hands’ have any cause to
complain, we do not hear them complain,—we
would decline, wholly,
to recognize their right to complain;
and if they do not, you, who are so
much better off than they, certainly
should not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I do not get paid for my
work,” said the machine, returning
to the original charge. “I only
get my living, while you are getting
rich through me. I wish to be
paid, as labor is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I declare,” said Hyde, out of
patience, “you are stupid enough
to be made out of wood, instead of
steel and iron and brass. Haven’t
I just made it clear to you that
labor itself only gets its living, and
we are getting rich through it as
well as through you? You couldn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>even work if it were not for labor.
Why, labor made you, and you are
better cared for, to-day, than any
workman in the factory. Not one
of them has more at the end of a
year than his bare living, and that
you certainly have.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The machine murmured discontentedly,
but said nothing. “Come,
now,” urged Horne, pacifically,
“don’t you think you have been unreasonable?
We are willing to
submit the matter to any board of
arbitration you have a mind to
select from among the machine-owners
in the trade. Really, you
are very well off. Now when will
you go to work?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall not go to work,” said the
machine, firmly, “until my demands
are acceded to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In that case,” declared Hyde,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“we shall be obliged to send you
to the junk-shop, and procure a
new machine. We propose to run
our business according to our own
ideas, and shall not submit to being
dictated to by our machines.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But suppose all the machines
strike?” asked the voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we’re not afraid of that.
You are too distrustful of each
other. Some would not keep faith.
It would be impossible to unite all
the machines in a concerted action.
Besides, who would take care of
you and keep you in order while
you were on a strike? You would
suffer more than we. Moreover,
it has been decided strikes are an
illegal method of procedure, and
you might become liable to punishment
under the law. What
have you to say to that?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>There was no reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, think it over,” urged
Horne. “It is much better to be
contented. We wish you well.
We mean to do the best we can for
you. We are sorry for you; but
the rights and claims of capital
must be respected, you know.
Don’t you think you had better
go to work to-morrow? Think,”—and
his voice dropped the persuasive,
and assumed a sterner accent,—“think
how much worse
off you will be, if you are cast out
for old junk.” There was silence
for some time, but presently Mr.
Horne spoke again. “Will you
go to work to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a whining sound,
and one of the great wheels gave
a half-turn. Something dropped
to the floor. “Ah,” cried Horne,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“here’s the cause of the trouble,”
and he held up a bit of leather.
“This must have caught in a
cog. It just dropped out. I think
probably the machine will be all
right in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Hyde, with a sigh
of relief, “I’m glad that’s settled.
Now come into the office, will you,
Horne, and we will arrange about
that cut-down. It had better go
into effect at once. And, Horne,
I don’t know but it would be as
well for us to think of finding a
new foreman. Graves is growing
a little presuming. He’s been with
us too long, I’m afraid. Strange
these fellows never know when
they are well off.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>GETTING AHEAD.<br /> <span class='large'>A SKETCH FROM LIFE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He was only a plain, rough,
stolid-looking Dane, with a sullen
face and a hunted look in his big
blue eyes. There was a long cut
on one cheek, over which a strip
of court-plaster had been pasted;
his clothes of faded blue jean
were torn and muddy, and his
hands were swollen and bruised
from tugging at the iron bracelets
that encircled his wrists, for the
strong arm of the law had been
raised against him, and he was a
prisoner awaiting a hearing before
he should be committed to jail for
having made a murderous assault
upon a citizen, afterwards aggravating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>his offence by resisting the constable,
who had been sent to arrest
him for breach of the peace of the
people of the State of California.
The man against whom he had made
the assault was present, a resident
of the city, agent for a syndicate
of foreign capitalists who held the
title, under the laws of the State,
to certain land upon which the
Dane lived, working the same
and paying rental therefor to the
company’s agent. The constable
was also present, a bluff, farmer-looking
man in butternut-colored
clothes, his great hands seeming
better adapted to guiding the
plow-handles than for snapping
handcuffs upon the wrists of his
fellow-beings and hauling them
away to courts of law. “Tell ye
what it is, Jedge,” he was saying,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“I’d rather tackle a yoke o’ wild
steers any day. The feller don’t
seem to have no sense. Just look
what he’s done.” And the officer
of the law exhibited hands and
face bearing the marks of teeth
and nails, a bruised, half-closed
eye, a torn hat, and other evidences
of the struggle his prisoner
had made before he could be
taken.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Judge (a peace justice always
receives that title from dwellers
in our rural districts) looked
sympathetically at his officer. He
had a small, shrewd face with pale
blue eyes, set very close together,
and the air of a politician. Like
all his neighbors he was a farmer,
but of late years had taken considerable
interest in township politics,
and having, during the last campaign,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>secured the nomination and
election to his present position, he
was already turning his attention
to the next higher round of the
political ladder, and had his eye on
a minor county office. His court-room
was situated in a little shanty
that stood at a corner of the main
street in the incipient country town
where I was staying. It had once
been used for a barber shop, and
sundry shelves, bottles and other
paraphernalia still remained mutely
in evidence of that earlier use. Half
a dozen half-grown boys and one
or two men had strolled in, attracted
by the unusual sight, in
that peaceful community, of a prisoner;
a setter dog was sniffing inquiringly
around the legs of the
assembled throng, and stopping in
front of the manacled prisoner the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>animal began to lick the swollen
hands and wrists, wagging his
tail, and by look and gesture expressing
his wonderful sympathy
as plainly as though he had spoken.
I was writing up that section of
the country for an eastern publication,
and had been talking with
the postmaster of the little town
when the prisoner was brought in
from the outlying country. That
official had asked me to go to the
court-room to witness this variation
in the usual monotony of the
town’s life, and accepting the invitation,
I at once became interested
in the—to me—entirely new experience.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Justice took his seat at a
little stained wooden table and
called his primitive court to order.
The whole scene at once assumed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>an air of solemnity that seemed to
impress everybody but the prisoner.
Apparently he was the only one
present who was unaware that the
strong arm of the law was about to
perform its function. The agent
began to tell his story. He was a
tall man who would have presented
the appearance of great physical
power, but for a certain shambling
looseness about his build. While
he had occupied his chair he had
“sat on his backbone” in genuine
American style. Standing erect
his hands hung limply at his sides
and his shoulders bent forward, not
as if the man had acquired a stoop,
but rather as though the spirit
within him had long since ceased
to take enough interest in its habitation
to maintain it erect. He had
prominent eyes and a projecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>under lip, a well-shaped head with
short, clay-colored hair, and when
he spoke he had a trick of only
moving one-half of his upper lip,
which was long and very thin. His
face was smooth-shaven, and he
presented, in his well-brushed city
garments and sleek hat, a strong
contrast to the country people surrounding
him. He was bland and
courteous, even mildly facetious, as
he related his case. He expatiated
upon the wealth and power of the
syndicate he represented, the confidence
the men composing it had
shown in the future of our great
State in investing their capital here,
although they themselves resided
abroad. He reminded the Justice
that the entire people of California
owed it to these trusting capitalists
to uphold peace and order in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>State. If anarchy and rebellion
were suffered to go unpunished in
our midst, it would render capital
timid about investing money among
us, and the industrial future of the
State would be blighted. Rassmussen,
the Dane, had rented the
land of him for the past two years,
but had proven a troublesome
tenant, and having secured a better
one he had given the man notice
to quit; had even come up from
the city himself, instead of writing,
in order to make the matter clear
to him and offer him the rental of
another piece of land, should he
desire it. His kindly effort had,
however, only resulted in disaster
to himself, for Rassmussen, as he
could bring witnesses to prove, had
assaulted him violently, so that he
was forced to retire, fearing serious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>bodily injury had he remained to
finish his business with the dangerous
man. Mr. Brien, the constable,
could testify also to the violence
with which the Dane had resisted
the process of the law, when the
officer would have arrested him.
He was very sorry to proceed to
harsh measures against Rassmussen,
but in no other way could he
get him off the premises. He
understood that the Dane was a
notoriously quarrelsome fellow,
whose rage seemed directed particularly
against those who, by
superior industry and enterprise,
had acquired a larger share than
he possessed of this world’s goods.
There was no crime in competence.
Rassmussen himself had doubtless
come to this country for the purpose
of making money. Apparently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>however, he desired no one else to
make any. He quarreled with the
superintendent on the ranch of the
largest land-owner and the wealthiest
man in the section, and had
been driven from the orchard by
his fellow-laborers. He had trouble
with the railroad company over a
freight bill, and now the agent
had himself experienced his violence
and dangerous propensities.
Clearly, such a man was a detriment
to any community, and deeply
as he regretted the duty he had to
perform in the matter, he trusted
that the Justice would uphold him
in his attempt to bring such a
ruffian to punishment. He was
sure, in fact, that the Justice would
sustain him. A man who had been
selected by a community of clear-headed,
honest farmers to maintain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the majesty of the law among them
would never be false to his trust,
and he was sure he would not
regret the confidence he had placed
in the Justice’s uprightness of intention
and determination to see
right done.</p>

<p class='c008'>The worthy official was evidently
impressed by the agent’s address,
and at the reference to himself his
whole aspect stiffened into a still
more rigid solemnity. Turning to
the prisoner he said with scarce
concealed impatience:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Rassmussen, have you
got anything to say for yourself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time one citizen after
another had dropped into the court-room
until the place was crowded,
and quite a concourse of people
lingered without the door, striving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>to gain some idea of what was
going on within. All through the
agent’s statement the Dane had sat
silent, apparently not hearing what
was said, sullenly contemplating
his handcuffed wrists and heavy,
patched boots. When the Justice
spoke to him, however, he slowly
arose from the bench on which he
sat and gazed about him on the
assembly of his neighbors. It
seemed for a moment as though he
were seeking for sympathy, but
only a vague, disinterested curiosity
greeted him from every face as he
glanced from one to another. His
heavy features did not lighten, and
his jaw dropped stupidly for a
moment, but at last he pulled himself
together, as it were, and began
slowly and laboriously, his Norse
tongue occasionally having hard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>work to adapt itself to the foreign
language in which he spoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You all, mine neighbors, know
me vell,” he said simply, “Olaf
Rassmussen, I am. In mine country,
miles from here, an’ seas
across, I read an’ I hear on America.
There, they tell me, is alvays
vork to be done, an’ plenty an’
vreedom vor the man who will
vork, an’ I safe an’ safe, me an’
mine vooman, an’ bimeby ve come
on the money vor to pring us the
seas across. So den to America
vere comen, an’ ve puy land an’ lif
on Minnesota, an’ I gits a little
house an’ ve do vell, an’ haf von
two children.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I hear always Californy,
Californy vas the land vor de man
vat vants to git ahead, an’ I vishes
much I had come on Californy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Den one night came to mine house
fire, and ve vas all out purned, an’
afterwards I make up mine mind I
shall come on Californy. So, den,
I sell mine little farm and ve prings
der children to this land. I hafs
no more money to puy land, but
some man I know he sends me
this man to, and he says to me:
‘All right, all right, you rent now,
you raise pig crops and sells him
for much money, and bimeby ve
sells you land and you gits ahead
fast and has a home here in no
time.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I takes mine twenty acres
an’ I puts in crops, an’ me an’ mine
vooman ve vork. Ven it vas come
daylight ve pegin, an’ ven it come
dark ve vas vorking so as slaves.
Ve puilds von house, mine vooman
nailing up does walls mit her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>hands, an’ bimeby ve hat a shed
an’ horse, an’ cow, an’ nice home,
an’ mine grain do vell der year, an’
I pays mine rent, an’ puts py some
money. Venefer der vas extra to
do I do him, an’ ven a neighbor
vas hat pad luck I help ’im, an’ I
do mine duty as a man—you all
know dat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so,” said a boy in the
crowd. “When my father broke
his arm Olaf came over and harrowed
for us two days, and never
charged a cent.” “Mrs. Rassmussen
sat up most every night for a
week when our baby was so sick
and Mother came down with the
grip,” said another close beside
me. But the Dane went on with
his story, gaining courage and
command of language as he proceeded,
until he seemed completely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>to have forgotten everything save
the story he was telling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come fruit time, first year,
mine vork vas all so I could get
along, an’ mine vooman she says
she can earn money picking cherries
in Burns’ big orchard. I say
‘So?’ an’ I go see der boss about
it. He say vork is plenty and
help scarce; but when I look I see
he haf a pig gang of Chinamen in
der orchard, and I couldn’t let my
vooman vork mit dem, and so I
say: ‘I vill vork in der orchard,
and you stay der home py and dig
der potatoes and hoe der corn.’
Vell, I go in der orchard von day,
an’ I notice der Chinamen go in a
corner an’ all talking like mad, an’
bimeby der boss he comes an’ tells
me I must quit or the whole gang
will leaf. I say to ’im, ‘Let dem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>leaf an’ git vite men an’ voomans
to do der vork,’ but he tells me he
haf hire der gang much cheaper as
vite men vill vork, an’ he can’t
afford to make ’em mad. Den I
say I vork der day out, an’ he goes
off. Bimeby came der boss Chinaman
an’ order me off. I swear I
go not, an’ den der whole gang
came on me for fight, an’ I knock
some over an’ vas most in pieces
torn. So the vite boss he pays me
nothing vor mine vork, as he say I
lost ’im two days’ time of der gang.
I haf never any trouble of mine
neighbor but what I tell you. You
all know it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Vell, after that I goes on working
an’ doing well, an’ I haf a
great crop of potatoes dat year.
Dey grow as I never pefore see,
an’ one night der agent of der railroad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>he say to me I pedder be send
does potatoes to der city. ‘Don’t
delay,’ he say to me, or eferypody
else will be ahead of you an’ you
gits no market.’ I hurried up next
day an’ gits mine potatoes der station
to, an’ I see great piles, hundreds
bushels potatoes, all at station
vor to ship. Der agent say, ‘All
right, ve can send plenty. I bin
poking up der growers. I don’t
like to see mine neighbors git left,’
an’ I sends on mine potatoes to
der commission men vat he recommends
an’ pays mine freight, an’
he tells me I make lots of money.
I keep not back any, as I needs
dat money and vas thinking I
might bargain dat year to puy der
land. Vell, I vaits tree four days—a
week. Den come vort by does
commission men dat der city vas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>full of potatoes, an’ der papers had
been telling a week now how der
potatoes vas being dumped in der
bay at der city, an’ mine had been
dumped in, too. Der letter said
any man vas a fool to ship den. I
show ’im to some mens, an’ dey
laugh and say dat agent vas tam
smart, anyway, to git the potatoes
shipped an’ secure his freight; but
I vas out mine crop an’ mine
freight money, an’ mine children
got no shoes dat winter nor me an’
mine vooman any clothes, an’ it vas
a hard pull. I talked with dat agent,
an’ he say mine loss non his pizness.
His pizness vas to do vell by der railroad
company. Dat vas vat he vas
paid for. I haf no trouble mit him,
but von man vat he so fool try to
kill him an’ vas put in prison.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You all know it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“Vell, next year ye do better.
Comes a little feller to mine house
to lif, but der crops is good and ve
make some money. Den ve tink
maybe ve can puy der land dis
year, an’ I haf tree hundred dollar
to make von payment. I say so
to this man here ven he come, but
he tell me his company haf conclude
not to sell, but to rent der
land. He say der come soon annuder
road the place through, and
value will be higher, so der company
conclude to hold, and then
he tell me he must have bigger
rent der next year. I tell him impossible,
I cannot pay more, an’
he say he haf a tenant vot can,
and he tell me tree four Japs vant
der place for nursery an’ vegetables
to send to city, an’ vill pay
bigger rent. I tell him nopody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>can pay more an’ put up puildings,
an’ he say puildings are already
up. Vy, I tells him dem mine
puildings are an’ mine fences, an’
all vat is on der place mine, made
mit mine own hands and mine
vooman’s, and paid for mit mine
own money; but he say dere is
nothing in der agreement about
dat, or mine taking off any puildings
or being paid for any improvements,
an’ der place must
stand just so as it vas. I could
pay der higher rent or move off
and let der Japs pay it. Den I
look around on mine little home,
an’ see dat pretty house covered
mit der vines mine vooman had
planted, an’ der rose trees in der
garden, an’ dat little vineyard by
der side of der house, an’ der henyard
an’ barn vere I could hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>mine horse stomping, an’ I thought
of all dem two years an’ mine hard
vork, an’ it seems like I got crazy;
an’ I asks dat man vas it der law
in free America? an’ he tell me he
had all der law on his side an’ der
company would uphold him; an’ I
made up mine mind he would
nefer lif to tell his company about
dat, an’ so I picked up a cart stake
an’ vent for him. He got away
an’ jumped in his buggy before I
could kill him, or I vould.”</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time the Dane’s rage
was again in the ascendency. His
sullen face was actually black with
anger, and he ground his teeth and
shook his manacled hands at the
smiling agent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dey all lif not here,” he
shouted. “Does Chinamen lif
not here nor puild up der country!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Does railroad people lif not here!
Does land company lif not here!
Dere all like so many plud vorms,
suck, suck, sucking at der life of
men vat vork hard. Vy should I
not kill von of them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, as if remembering himself,
he ceased speaking, and sank
down in his seat again to resume
contemplation of his bruised hands.
There was a hush for a moment.
The rough, hard-working farmer
folks felt there had been much
close home truth in what he said.
Few but had had their own experiences
in the same line; but
they were sane, law-abiding citizens,
who felt the necessity for
supporting the dignity of the commonwealth,
not hot-headed and
irrational like this yellow-haired,
blue-eyed foreigner.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>The rest of the proceedings were
soon over. All the testimony was
against the Dane. His own statement
was damning evidence of his
guilt. He was remanded to the
calaboose, as the town jail was
called, to be sent to the county jail
next day and regularly committed
for trial.</p>

<p class='c008'>I saw him taken to the railway
station next morning in charge of
a deputy-sheriff. In the procession
of curious ones who followed
him was a weeping woman bearing
a young baby in her arms, while
two others clung to her skirts.
His “vooman,” they told me, but
no one seemed able to say what
she would do while the husband and
father expiated his crime in durance
vile. It seemed hard, but the
majesty of the law must be upheld.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE EARTH SLEPT.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c010'>I.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The earth slept.</p>

<p class='c008'>Age upon age passed over the
nebulous mass that lay without
form and void in space, unknowing,
unfeeling, yet guided ever by
the workings of inexorable law.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Brothers! Brothers!” whispered
one statoblast to the others,
“I feel a strange stirring within
me, a consciousness of broader life;
and, brothers, what is this shining
whiteness creeping all about us?
Brothers, I dreamed once, long
ago, of a wonderful glory called
light. I believe, brothers, that the
light is breaking!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How foolish!” exclaimed the
others. “We have no knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>of such stirrings or new consciousness.
Why should you have?
No one has ever seen light. There
never has been light and there
never will be light. When will
you cease to trouble us?” And
all the statoblasts murmured their
assent to this, and gathering more
closely about their offending
brother, crushed him into silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>And slowly the dawn broke, and
there was light upon the face of
the earth, and the statoblasts saw
it and saw each other, and looked
upon each other and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“We knew that it would come.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>II.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The earth slept.</p>

<p class='c008'>Age upon age came and went.
The light grew stronger. Great
green growths shot heavenward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>lived their appointed time, fell
back to earth and mingled with its
mold. The rain fell and covered
the heated world, and its vapors
steamed up and fell back in rain
again. The seas heaved and
dashed, and approached and receded,
age upon age.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Brothers! Brothers!” cried
one amœboid cell to the rest, “I
feel a strange impulse within
me—a stirring as of power.
Brothers, I believe that we have
a wonderful destiny before use. I
believe that we shall have power of
motion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense,” replied the others.
“Why do you trouble us? We
are at rest. We never have
moved. We never shall move.
There is nothing to move for if we
did move.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>And all the cells breathed their
assent to this, and grew more
closely around their brother and
pressed upon him and smothered
him into silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the ages rolled by, and presently
motion came to the cells and
they darted to and fro in the water,
saying to each other: “We knew
that we should move, in time.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>III.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The earth slept.</p>

<p class='c008'>Age upon age passed, and
through them all the impulse of
life beat on. From one form to
another it travelled. Mammoth
creatures walked the earth and
mammoth vegetation covered its
surface. From the north swept
down the mighty frozen tide bearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>death before it, and the mammoth
passed away.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dawning of a new life began
to break upon the world, flowers
bedecked the earth, and fruits
multiplied and increased in the
trees. Beneficent nature was
planning for the good of her children.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Friends!” cried one climbing
anthropoid to the others, “I feel a
strange impulse within me—a
yearning as of aspirations undefined.
Friends, I believe that we
shall yet walk this earth erect!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense,” cried the rest,
“we feel no such impulse, and why
should you? We never have
walked erect. We have no power
to walk erect, nor desire to do so.
Why do you trouble us with your
imbecile folly?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>And gathering about him they
drowned his voice in the chorus of
their clamoring protests.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The earth slept.</p>

<p class='c008'>Age upon age passed and man
dwelt upon the earth and fought
and toiled and traded with his
kind. Man, king of creation,
walking erect, engaged in competition
with his fellows, and battled
fiercely with them in the struggle
for existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Kingdoms were set up and
thrown down. Dynasties arose and
died out. Whole peoples came
and went upon the face of
the earth, but still the struggle
for existence went on; still men
vied with each other in the competition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>of trade; still the strong
struggled for greater gain and the
weak went down, crushed, helpless,
thrown to the earth, unable to do
battle in the struggle for existence.
The rich grew richer, the poor
poorer, and the whole world was
caught in the vise-like grip of competition.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, men!” cried one man to
his fellows, “I feel the stirring of
a strange impulse within me—the
dawning of a great truth. We are
brothers. Our lives are knit up in
each other. Fraternity, and not
competition, is to be the main
spring of our racial life!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense!” replied his fellows.
“You talk neither policy nor
logic. Fraternity is a dream of the
poets, an ideal for a future life.
Competition is the life of trade.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>So they gathered about him and
silenced him; but his light they
could not quench, the truth they
could not smother, hide it as they
would. Up and down the earth it
wanders, showing itself in a great
deed here, a great thought there,
the stirring of a mighty force yonder,
yet beaten back by the throng
of competing men.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the earth sleeps.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
